Make sure you have python, build-essential, etc

Install conan (using pip): https://docs.conan.io/2/installation.html
I had to install with sudo pip install conan

Run (if you haven't already): conan profile detect --force
Run: conan install . --output-folder=cmake --build=missing

Then do: cmake .

Then do: everything
